                <h3>Debriefing on the New Laptop I Just Got</h3>
                <p>Oh my God... The performance on this new laptop I got is just... ASTOUNDING! I can actually play game and use my laptop without it exploding into a million pieces! But anyways, it's a much needed upgrade. An Acer Aspire A315 to a Lenovo Legion 5i is such a big upgrade.</p>
                <p>I would prattle on about how much I'm enjoying the performance difference, but I would sound like a broken record, so I'll stop here.</p>

                <h3>R.E.P.O: A Game of Collecting and Screaming Obscenities</h3>
                <p>This game has been a delight to play, even though I've mostly screamed and ran for my life most of the time. The Discord people that I've met has been a delight to be with. Love language lang na "bullying" aside, it's a great chance for me to meet new people and actually interact with them rather than just sitting by the sidelines and looking at them with fear.</p>
